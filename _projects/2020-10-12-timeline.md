## Creating an interactive timeline with TimelineJS

Here is an example of an interactive timeline created for an introductory lecture for the second semester of a U.S. history class. This timeline allows for a brief overview of the major events covered in the first semester of the course, roughly covering the years 1492-1865.[^1]
