# James Carroll's temporary instructional design portfolio

I am an instructional designer, academic, and musician from Massachusetts. This portfolio site has been created using the Jekyll static site generator and posted to GitHub Pages. [The Jekyll theme, which I purchased from jekyllthemes.io, is called Index](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/index-portfolio-jekyll-theme).

This is a temporary site because I have purchased a dedicated URL for an instructional design portfolio (pulamusic-portfolio.com), but the details of configuring the site with AWS are pretty vague. I may have an interview within the week that will require an online portfolio, so here is the temp site.
